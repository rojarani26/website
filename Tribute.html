       <ul>
        <li><b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam </b>was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007.</li>
        <li> He was born and raised in <b>Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu</b> and studied physics and aerospace engineering. </li>
        <li> He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the<i> Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)</i> and <i>Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)</i> and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as the <strong>Missile Man of India</strong>  for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.</li> 
        <li> He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</li>
        <li>Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress.</li>
        <li>Widely referred to as the<b> "People's President"</b>,he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. </li>
        <li>  He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the <b>Bharat Ratna</b>, India's highest civilian honour.</li>
        <li>When Dr. Kalam became the President of India in 2002, he was supposed to address students at a school function. But when he reached there to start his speech, the electricity suddenly went off. Instead of complaining, he asked the students to gather around to listen to him.</li> 
        <li>When he was the President of India, he used to donate all his savings to the social cause- <b>Pura (Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas)</b>, a strategy for rural development in India. </li>
        <li>While delivering a lecture at the <b>Indian Institute of Management Shillong</b>, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on <b>27 July 2015, aged 83.</b> Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.</li>
